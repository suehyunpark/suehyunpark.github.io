<!-- Write your biography here. Tell the world about yourself. Link to your favorite [subreddit](http://reddit.com). You can put a picture in, too. The code is already in, just name your picture `prof_pic.jpg` and put it in the `img/` folder.

Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any of these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.

Link to your social media connections, too. This theme is set up to use [Font Awesome icons](https://fontawesome.com/) and [Academicons](https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/), like the ones below. Add your Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google Scholar, or just disable all of them. -->

Hello! I am a first year M.S. student in [KAIST Graduate School of AI (KAIST AI)](https://gsai.kaist.ac.kr/). I am fortunate to be advised by [Minjoon Seo](https://seominjoon.github.io/) in [Language & Knowledge Lab (LKLab)](https://LKLab.kaist.ac.kr/). Previously, I received a B.B.A. and B.S. in Artificial Intelligence from [Seoul National University](https://en.snu.ac.kr/index.html). I have also interned at [FriendliAI](https://friendli.ai/) in its early stage, envisioning the business impact of generative AI models.  
  
I am interested in how language models interpret and synthesize complex, context-rich information. I have analyzed [hallucinative behavior](https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.07362) and [fine-grained evaluation capabilities](https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.06591) of vision-language models and am currently working on evaluating the depth of model responses in interactions with human users. I am also exploring the principles of deliberative thinking and causal reasoning to improve how language models comprehend and articulate the complex interplay among concepts, values, and behaviors humans possess.
