<!-- Write your biography here. Tell the world about yourself. Link to your favorite [subreddit](http://reddit.com). You can put a picture in, too. The code is already in, just name your picture `prof_pic.jpg` and put it in the `img/` folder.

Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any of these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.

Link to your social media connections, too. This theme is set up to use [Font Awesome icons](https://fontawesome.com/) and [Academicons](https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/), like the ones below. Add your Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google Scholar, or just disable all of them. -->

Hello! I am a first year M.S. student in [KAIST AI](https://gsai.kaist.ac.kr/). I am fortunate to be advised by [Minjoon Seo](https://seominjoon.github.io/) in [Language & Knowledge Lab](https://LKLab.kaist.ac.kr/). Previously, I received B.B.A. and B.S. degrees from [Seoul National University](https://en.snu.ac.kr/index.html). I also interned at [FriendliAI](https://friendli.ai/) in its early stage, envisioning the business impact of generative AI models.  
  
My research lies in the area of natural language processing and machine learning. I study enhancing generalization of large (vision) language models using a data-centric approach and understanding complex reasoning abilities in large language models. My research interests include pluralistic alignment, inductive and causal reasoning, and AI safety and security. Here is my [CV](assets/pdf/CV_SueHyun_Park_public.pdf){: target='_blank'}.
<!-- My research lies in the area of natural language processing and machine learning, with ongoing interests in AI safety/security (since undergrad!). I study novel synthetic data generation strategies to improve generalization of (vision) language models when given highly contextual information ([self-feedback-decision-revision](https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.07362), [fine-grained evaluation criteria](https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.06591), [personalized system messages](https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.17977)). I also analyze knowledge dependencies for complex reasoning ([reasoning graph with varying depths of knowledge](https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.19502)). My current goal is to improve language models' robustness against adversarial inputs through better reasoning of action implications and decision-making. -->

<!-- Specifically, I am interested in how to guide language models to interpret and synthesize complex, context-rich information. I am also interested in improving safe use of (vision) language models. -->
 <!-- I am also interested in modeling the human context, specifically individual values, behaviors, and preferences. -->
<!-- I have analyzed [hallucinative behavior](https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.07362) and [fine-grained evaluation capabilities](https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.06591) of vision-language models, and recently [proposed a zero-shot alignment method to individual preferences](https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.17977).  -->
